Mac-Os-Tiling
=============

A script for tiling windows of the current program

The original script is taken from [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060105082728937) and it's a little modified.

It can be used with a keyboard shortcut, through [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) for example.
